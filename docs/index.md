**LittleLogBook is a desktop application designed to help Kindergarten teachers manage important contact details.** While it provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), most user interactions are optimised for the Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling faster and more efficient use.

LittleLogBook allows teachers to conveniently track information about their students, parents, and colleagues, making communication and record-keeping easier.

* If you are interested in using LittleLogBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
