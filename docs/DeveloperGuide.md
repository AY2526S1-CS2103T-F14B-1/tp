## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />
</div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />
</div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="maxwidth"/>
</div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="maxwidth"/>
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>
</div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800"/>
</div>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />
</div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View Command

#### Implementation
The `view` command displays detailed information about a specific person in a pop-up window.

**Operation:** `view INDEX`

**How it works:**
1. Parses the user-provided index using ViewCommandParser 
2. Validates that the index is within bounds of the current filtered list 
3. Retrieves the corresponding person from the filtered person list using Model#getFilteredPersonList()
4. Creates a ViewCommand object with the target index 
5. When executed, opens a pop-up window (ViewWindow) displaying all person details 
6. The main window remains accessible while the view window is open

**Overall Sequence Diagram for View:**

    <puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram-Overall.puml" alt="ViewOverState" />
</div>

Below is the more in depth breakdown of the Logic and UI Sequence diagrams.

</div>
<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram-UI.puml" alt="ViewUIState" />
</div>

### Remind Command

#### Implementation
The `remind` command shows current and upcoming birthdays.

**Operation:** `remind`

**How it works:**
1. User launch the program
2. Remind command is automatically called
3. Get list of persons whose birthdays is today or in the upcoming 7 days. 
4. Displays a list of upcoming events/birthdays 
5. Can show both students and colleagues with upcoming dates

**Sequence Diagram for Automated Remind on start:**
<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/RemindSequenceDiagram-Auto.puml" alt="RemindAutoState" />
</div>

**Key Classes:**
- `RemindCommand` - Handles the command execution
- `Birthday` - Contains date logic for reminder calculations
- `Person` - Stores birthday information

**Validation for Birthday:**
- The Birthday class implements comprehensive date validation with the following constraints:
- Format Validation 
  - Required Format: `dd-MM-yyyy` (e.g., 24-12-2005)
  - Regex Pattern: `^\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}$` ensures exactly 2 digits for day, 2 for month, and 4 for year 
  - Strict Parsing: Uses `ResolverStyle.STRICT` to reject invalid dates like 31-04-2023 (April has only 30 days)
- Temporal Constraints 
  - Minimum Date: 01-01-1900 - Prevents unrealistically old birth dates 
  - Maximum Date: Current date - Prevents future birth dates 
  - Range Validation: Ensures birthday falls between January 1, 1900 and today

### Saving data

##### Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

1. **Simulating missing data file:**
    - Navigate to the `data/` folder in your LittleLogBook directory
    - Delete or rename the `addressbook.json` file
    - Launch LittleLogBook
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should start with a fresh empty address book and create a new `addressbook.json` file automatically

<br>

2. **Simulating corrupted data file:**
    - Open the `data/addressbook.json` file in a text editor
    - Manually modify the JSON structure to be invalid, for example:
        - Remove essential fields like `"name"`, `"phone"`, etc. from a contact
        - Change field types (e.g., change a phone number to an array: `"phone": [12345678]`)
        - Introduce JSON syntax errors (remove closing braces, add extra commas)
        - Add invalid date formats in birthday/attendance fields
        - Remove the entire `"persons"` array or make it null
    - Save the file and launch LittleLogBook
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should detect the corruption and start with an empty address book.

<br>

3. **Testing with invalid birthday formats:**
    - Change a contact's birthday to an invalid format (e.g., `"32-13-2020"`, `"birthday": "not-a-date"`)
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should either use a default date or show an error during startup

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Finding contacts
##### Similar process for the different find commands (`find-n`, `find-c`, `find-t`, `find-p` )

1. **Simulating find for no-matches:**
    - Add contacts to the LittleLogBook with no names containing z or y, no classes containing K1A
    - Input the find command with required parameter(s) to find for an information such as partial name that does not exist in your contacts
        - Test case: `find-p 123456789 `
        - Test case: `find-n zy z y`
        - Test case: `find-c k1A`
    - Press enter
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should show empty contact list with information on how to proceed.

<br>

2. **Simulating find for matches:**
    - Add contacts to the LittleLogBook with class starting with K, names containing b and/or d
    - Input the find command with required parameter(s) to find for an information such as partial phone number that exists in your contacts
        - Test case: `find-p 8 9`
        - Test case: `find-c k`
        - Test case: `find-n b d`
        - Test case: `find-t stu coll`
    - Press enter
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should show filtered contact list of only those that match the input string with information on how to proceed.

<br>

3. **Simulating find with no parameter inputs:**
   - Input the find command with no parameter
        - - Test case: `find-c `
   - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should say `invalid command format` and guide users on next steps.
   
<br>
   
4. **Simulating find with wrong parameter inputs:**
   - Input the find command 
       - Example: passing in alphabetic string for find-p command
       - Test case: `find-p ala`
       - Test case: `find-t 1`
       - Test case: `find-n @ !`
       - Test case: `find-c !`
   - Press enter
   - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should state the valid inputs that are allowed to guide user.

<box type="info" seamless="true">

**Note:** To continue testing other commands, use `list` command as guided by LittleLogBook GUI to escape the filtered view.

</box>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Favourite contacts

1. **Simulating adding a contact to favourites for the first time:**
    - Add a new contact to a LittleLogBook
    - Input the `fav` command with index of newly added contact 
        - Test case: `fav 1` assuming added contact is the first contact
    - Press enter
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should show a successful message with the name of the added contact. There will be a star icon indicated next to that contact.

<br>

2. **Simulating removing a contact from favourites:**
    - Add a new contact to the LittleLogBook
    - Do the process of adding that contact to favourites _(Refer to point 1 in this section)_
    - Input the favourite command with index of that specific contact
        - Test case: `fav 1` assuming added contact is the first contact
    - Press enter
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should show succesful message with information on the contact that is removed from favourites. The star icon next to the contact will disappear.

<br>
   
3. **Checking `list` behaviour:**
    - Add two new contacts to the LittleLogBook
    - Do the process of adding one of the two contacts to favourites _(Refer to point 1 in this section)_
        - Test case: `fav 2` assuming added contacts are the first and second respectively
    - Input `list` command
    - Press enter
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should show those added to favourites on the top of the list

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
1. **Command case sensitivity**
    - Test: `ADD`, `Add`, `add`<br>**Expected**: only commands in lower case should work (case-insensitive).

1. **Parameter order variations**
    - Test: `add p/98765432 n/John Doe` (reverse order)<br>**Expected**: Should work correctly.

1. **Extra spaces in commands**
    - Test: `add   n/John   Doe   p/98765432`<br>**Expected**: Should handle gracefully (trim spaces).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### System commands

**Note:** These instructions provide a starting point for testers. Testers should perform additional *exploratory* testing beyond these specified cases, including:
- Testing concurrent operations
- Testing boundary conditions
- Testing error recovery
- Testing UI responsiveness with different data volumes
