## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />
</div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />
</div>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="maxwidth"/>
</div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="maxwidth"/>
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>
</div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800"/>
</div>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />
</div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View Command

#### Implementation
The `view` command displays detailed information about a specific person in a pop-up window.

**Operation:** `view INDEX`

**How it works:**
1. Parses the user-provided index using ViewCommandParser 
2. Validates that the index is within bounds of the current filtered list 
3. Retrieves the corresponding person from the filtered person list using Model#getFilteredPersonList()
4. Creates a ViewCommand object with the target index 
5. When executed, opens a pop-up window (ViewWindow) displaying all person details 
6. The main window remains accessible while the view window is open

**Overall Sequence Diagram for View:**

    <puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram-Overall.puml" alt="ViewOverState" />
</div>

Below is the more in depth breakdown of the Logic and UI Sequence diagrams.

</div>
<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram-UI.puml" alt="ViewUIState" />
</div>

### Remind Command

#### Implementation
The `remind` command shows current and upcoming birthdays.

**Operation:** `remind`

**How it works:**
1. User launch the program
2. Remind command is automatically called
3. Get list of persons whose birthdays is today or in the upcoming 7 days. 
4. Displays a list of upcoming events/birthdays 
5. Can show both students and colleagues with upcoming dates

**Sequence Diagram for Automated Remind on start:**
<div align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/RemindSequenceDiagram-Auto.puml" alt="RemindAutoState" />
</div>

**Key Classes:**
- `RemindCommand` - Handles the command execution
- `Birthday` - Contains date logic for reminder calculations
- `Person` - Stores birthday information

**Validation for Birthday:**
- The Birthday class implements comprehensive date validation with the following constraints:
- Format Validation 
  - Required Format: `dd-MM-yyyy` (e.g., 24-12-2005)
  - Regex Pattern: `^\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}$` ensures exactly 2 digits for day, 2 for month, and 4 for year 
  - Strict Parsing: Uses `ResolverStyle.STRICT` to reject invalid dates like 31-04-2023 (April has only 30 days)
- Temporal Constraints 
  - Minimum Date: 01-01-1900 - Prevents unrealistically old birth dates 
  - Maximum Date: Current date - Prevents future birth dates 
  - Range Validation: Ensures birthday falls between January 1, 1900 and today

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: Popup window appears for confirmation. After the user confirms to proceed with the deletion, first contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

##### Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

1. **Simulating missing data file:**
    - Navigate to the `data/` folder in your LittleLogBook directory
    - Delete or rename the `addressbook.json` file
    - Launch LittleLogBook
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should start with a fresh empty address book and create a new `addressbook.json` file automatically

<br>

2. **Simulating corrupted data file:**
    - Open the `data/addressbook.json` file in a text editor
    - Manually modify the JSON structure to be invalid, for example:
        - Remove essential fields like `"name"`, `"phone"`, etc. from a contact
        - Change field types (e.g., change a phone number to an array: `"phone": [12345678]`)
        - Introduce JSON syntax errors (remove closing braces, add extra commas)
        - Add invalid date formats in birthday/attendance fields
        - Remove the entire `"persons"` array or make it null
    - Save the file and launch LittleLogBook
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should detect the corruption and start with an empty address book.

<br>

3. **Testing with invalid birthday formats:**
    - Change a contact's birthday to an invalid format (e.g., `"32-13-2020"`, `"birthday": "not-a-date"`)
    - **Expected behavior:** LittleLogBook should either use a default date or show an error during startup
